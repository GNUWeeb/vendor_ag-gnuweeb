Subject: [PATCH 16/16] inputflinger: fix relative mouse movement

Since commit 78f97b326 ("Support pointer capture in InputReader") the
logic to determine whether mouse input is relative was changed.
However, commit 447a667 was forward ported from nougat-x86. It doesn't
consider that.

Fixes: 447a667 ("inputflinger: treat tablet-style inputs as absolute coordinate mouse pointer")
